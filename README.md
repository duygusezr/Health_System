🎮 Unity FPS Game - Health System & AI
This project is a First-Person Shooter (FPS) prototype developed in Unity, featuring a dynamic health system, enemy AI, and UI integration. The player's health is displayed through a health bar (UI) with a percentage indicator. Enemies can track and attack the player, dealing damage upon collision. The game also includes healing objects that restore health when stepped on and disappear after use.
